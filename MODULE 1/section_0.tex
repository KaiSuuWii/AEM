\subsection*{Series}

A \textbf{series} is the sum of the terms of a sequence. If $\{a_n\}$ is a sequence, then the corresponding series is written as
\[
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots
\]

The value of a series is determined by the behavior of its \textbf{partial sums}
\[
    S_N = \sum_{n=1}^{N} a_n.
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item The series \textbf{converges} if $\displaystyle \lim_{N \to \infty} S_N$ exists and is finite.
    \item The series \textbf{diverges} if this limit does not exist or is infinite.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Necessary Condition for Convergence:}
\[
    \lim_{n \to \infty} a_n = 0.
\]
If this condition is not satisfied, the series must diverge.
