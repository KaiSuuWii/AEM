\subsection{Hermite Polynomials}

Hermite polynomials arise in systems involving Gaussian-type solutions and are essential in quantum mechanics and probability theory.

\subsubsection{Hermite's Differential Equation}

Hermite's equation is
\[
    y'' - 2xy' + 2ny = 0,
\]
where $n$ is a nonnegative integer.

\begin{conceptbox}
    Polynomial solutions of Hermite's equation are called \textbf{Hermite polynomials}, denoted by $H_n(x)$.
\end{conceptbox}

\subsubsection{First Few Hermite Polynomials}

The first few Hermite polynomials are:
\[
    H_0(x)=1,
    \qquad
    H_1(x)=2x,
    \qquad
    H_2(x)=4x^2-2,
    \qquad
    H_3(x)=8x^3-12x.
\]

\subsubsection{Applications of Hermite Polynomials}

Hermite polynomials appear in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum harmonic oscillator,
    \item Probability and statistics (Gaussian distributions),
    \item Signal processing and approximation theory.
\end{itemize}
