\subsection{Hypergeometric Functions}

Hypergeometric functions are among the most general special functions. Many other special functions (such as Bessel, Legendre, and Hermite functions) can be written as special cases of hypergeometric functions.

\subsubsection{Hypergeometric Differential Equation}

The hypergeometric equation is
\[
    x(1-x)y'' + \big[c-(a+b+1)x\big]y' - ab\,y = 0,
\]
where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are constants.

\begin{conceptbox}
    The solution of the hypergeometric equation is called the \textbf{Gaussian hypergeometric function}, written as
    \[
        {}_2F_1(a,b;c;x).
    \]
\end{conceptbox}

\subsubsection{Series Definition}

The hypergeometric function is defined by the power series
\[
    {}_2F_1(a,b;c;x)
    =
    \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
    \frac{(a)_n(b)_n}{(c)_n}
    \frac{x^n}{n!},
\]
where $(a)_n$ is the \textbf{Pochhammer symbol} defined as
\[
    (a)_n = a(a+1)(a+2)\cdots(a+n-1),
    \qquad (a)_0 = 1.
\]

\subsubsection{Importance of Hypergeometric Functions}

\begin{noteBox}
    The hypergeometric function is a ``master function'' because many special functions can be expressed as hypergeometric series.
\end{noteBox}

\subsubsection{Applications of Hypergeometric Functions}

Hypergeometric functions appear in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Advanced mathematical physics models,
    \item Fluid dynamics and relativity,
    \item Engineering problems involving complex boundary conditions,
    \item Reduction of many differential equations into a single general form.
\end{itemize}
