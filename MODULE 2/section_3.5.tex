\subsection{Airy Functions}

Airy functions arise from differential equations with turning points and appear in wave propagation and quantum mechanics.

\subsubsection{Airy's Differential Equation}

The Airy equation is
\[
    y'' - xy = 0.
\]

\begin{conceptbox}
    The solutions of Airy's equation are the \textbf{Airy functions} $Ai(x)$ and $Bi(x)$.
\end{conceptbox}

\subsubsection{Series Form of Airy Functions}

The Airy functions can be expressed as power series solutions. Their series expansions lead to two linearly independent solutions that behave differently as $x$ becomes large.

\begin{noteBox}
    Airy functions are important in approximating solutions near boundary transition regions, where ordinary approximations fail.
\end{noteBox}

\subsubsection{Applications of Airy Functions}

Airy functions appear in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Diffraction and optics,
    \item Quantum tunneling problems,
    \item Beam deflection and elastic bending models.
\end{itemize}
