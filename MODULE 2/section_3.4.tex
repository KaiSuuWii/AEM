\subsection{Laguerre Polynomials}

Laguerre polynomials arise in problems involving radial solutions in quantum mechanics and certain boundary value problems.

\subsubsection{Laguerre's Differential Equation}

The Laguerre equation is
\[
    xy'' + (1-x)y' + ny = 0,
\]
where $n$ is a nonnegative integer.

\begin{conceptbox}
    Polynomial solutions of Laguerre's equation are called \textbf{Laguerre polynomials}, denoted by $L_n(x)$.
\end{conceptbox}

\subsubsection{First Few Laguerre Polynomials}

The first few Laguerre polynomials are:
\[
    L_0(x)=1,
    \qquad
    L_1(x)=1-x,
    \qquad
    L_2(x)=1-2x+\frac{x^2}{2}.
\]

\subsubsection{Applications of Laguerre Polynomials}

Laguerre polynomials are commonly used in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Quantum mechanics (hydrogen atom radial solutions),
    \item Electrical engineering models involving exponential decay,
    \item Approximation methods in numerical analysis.
\end{itemize}
