\subsection{Chebyshev Polynomials}

Chebyshev polynomials are important in approximation theory and numerical methods. They are closely related to trigonometric functions.

\subsubsection{Chebyshev Differential Equation}

The Chebyshev equation is
\[
    (1-x^2)y'' - xy' + n^2 y = 0.
\]

\begin{conceptbox}
    The polynomial solutions of this equation are called \textbf{Chebyshev polynomials}, denoted by $T_n(x)$.
\end{conceptbox}

\subsubsection{Trigonometric Definition}

Chebyshev polynomials can be defined as
\[
    T_n(x)=\cos(n\arccos x).
\]

\subsubsection{Applications of Chebyshev Polynomials}

Chebyshev polynomials are widely used in:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Polynomial approximation (minimax approximation),
    \item Numerical integration and interpolation,
    \item Digital signal processing filter design.
\end{itemize}
