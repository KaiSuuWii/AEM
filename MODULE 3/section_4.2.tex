\subsection{Equations of Planes}

A plane is a flat two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in three dimensions.
In 3D geometry, planes are commonly described using a point and a normal vector.

\subsubsection{Plane Equation Using a Normal Vector}

\begin{conceptbox}
    A plane passing through point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ with normal vector
    \[
        \mathbf{n}=[A,B,C]
    \]
    is given by the equation:
    \[
        \mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)=0,
    \]
    where $\mathbf{r}=[x,y,z]$ and $\mathbf{r}_0=[x_0,y_0,z_0]$.
\end{conceptbox}

Expanding:
\[
    [A,B,C]\cdot[x-x_0,\;y-y_0,\;z-z_0]=0
\]
\[
    A(x-x_0)+B(y-y_0)+C(z-z_0)=0.
\]

This simplifies to the standard plane equation:
\[
    Ax+By+Cz=D,
\]
where $D=Ax_0+By_0+Cz_0$.

\subsubsection{Plane Equation in Standard Form}

\begin{conceptbox}
    The standard equation of a plane is:
    \[
        Ax+By+Cz=D,
    \]
    where $\mathbf{n}=[A,B,C]$ is the normal vector of the plane.
\end{conceptbox}

\subsubsection{Parametric Form of a Plane}

A plane can also be expressed using two non-parallel direction vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$:

\begin{conceptbox}
    If a plane passes through point $P$ and contains direction vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$,
    then the plane can be written as:
    \[
        \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_0+s\mathbf{u}+t\mathbf{v},
    \]
    where $s,t\in\mathbb{R}$.
\end{conceptbox}

\begin{examplebox}
    Find the plane passing through $P(1,2,3)$ with normal vector $\mathbf{n}=[2,-1,4]$.

    Using:
    \[
        \mathbf{n}\cdot(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)=0,
    \]
    we have:
    \[
        [2,-1,4]\cdot[x-1,y-2,z-3]=0.
    \]

    Expanding:
    \[
        2(x-1) - (y-2) + 4(z-3)=0
    \]

    \[
        2x-2-y+2+4z-12=0
    \]

    \[
        2x-y+4z-12=0.
    \]

    Thus, the equation of the plane is:
    \[
        2x-y+4z=12.
    \]
\end{examplebox}

    In engineering, planes are used in structural mechanics, CAD modeling, robotics orientation,
    and describing surfaces in 3D space.
