\subsection{Intersections}

In engineering and geometry, intersections represent where objects meet, such as beams meeting at joints,
or planes cutting through structures.

\subsubsection{Intersection of a Line and a Plane}

To find where a line intersects a plane:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write the line in parametric form.
    \item Substitute into the plane equation.
    \item Solve for the parameter $t$.
    \item Substitute back to find the intersection point.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{examplebox}
    Find the intersection of the line
    \[
        x=1+2t,\qquad y=3-t,\qquad z=2+4t
    \]
    with the plane
    \[
        x+y+z=10.
    \]

    Substitute into the plane equation:
    \[
        (1+2t)+(3-t)+(2+4t)=10.
    \]

    Simplify:
    \[
        1+2t+3-t+2+4t=10
    \]
    \[
        6+5t=10
    \]
    \[
        5t=4
    \]
    \[
        t=\frac{4}{5}.
    \]

    Substitute back into the parametric equations:

    \[
        x=1+2\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)=1+\frac{8}{5}=\frac{13}{5}
    \]

    \[
        y=3-\frac{4}{5}=\frac{15}{5}-\frac{4}{5}=\frac{11}{5}
    \]

    \[
        z=2+4\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)=2+\frac{16}{5}=\frac{26}{5}
    \]

    Thus, the intersection point is:
    \[
        \left(\frac{13}{5},\frac{11}{5},\frac{26}{5}\right).
    \]
\end{examplebox}

\subsubsection{Intersection of Two Planes}

Two planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$ generally intersect in a line (unless they are parallel or identical).

\begin{noteBox}
    If two planes are not parallel, then their intersection is a straight line.
    This is important in CAD modeling and structural intersection analysis.
\end{noteBox}

\begin{examplebox}
    Consider the planes:
    \[
        x+y+z=6
    \]
    \[
        2x-y+z=3.
    \]

    Subtract the second from the first:
    \[
        (x+y+z)-(2x-y+z)=6-3
    \]
    \[
        -x+2y=3
    \]
    \[
        x=2y-3.
    \]

    Let $y=t$, then:
    \[
        x=2t-3.
    \]

    Substitute into the first plane:
    \[
        (2t-3)+t+z=6
    \]
    \[
        3t-3+z=6
    \]
    \[
        z=9-3t.
    \]

    Thus the intersection line is:
    \[
        x=2t-3,\qquad y=t,\qquad z=9-3t.
    \]

    Vector form:
    \[
        \mathbf{r}=[-3,0,9]+t[2,1,-3].
    \]
\end{examplebox}
