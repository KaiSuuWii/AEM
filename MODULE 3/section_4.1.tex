\section{Lines and Planes in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$}

\subsection{Equations of Lines}

A line is one of the most fundamental geometric objects in mathematics and engineering.
In vector calculus, lines are often represented using vectors because this form is very convenient
for describing direction and motion.

\subsubsection{Vector Equation of a Line}

\begin{conceptbox}
    A line passing through a point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ with direction vector $\mathbf{v}=[a,b,c]$ is given by:
    \[
        \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_0 + t\mathbf{v},
    \]
    where
    \[
        \mathbf{r}_0=[x_0,y_0,z_0], \qquad t\in\mathbb{R}.
    \]
\end{conceptbox}

Here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector of any point on the line,
    \item $\mathbf{r}_0$ is the position vector of a known point on the line,
    \item $\mathbf{v}$ gives the direction of the line,
    \item $t$ is a parameter that moves along the line.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Parametric Equations of a Line}

From the vector equation:
\[
    \mathbf{r} = [x,y,z] = [x_0,y_0,z_0] + t[a,b,c],
\]
we obtain the parametric equations:
\[
    x = x_0 + at,\qquad y = y_0 + bt,\qquad z = z_0 + ct.
\]

\subsubsection{Symmetric Form of a Line}

If $a,b,c\neq 0$, then we can eliminate $t$ and write:
\[
    \frac{x-x_0}{a} = \frac{y-y_0}{b} = \frac{z-z_0}{c}.
\]

This is called the \textbf{symmetric equation} of the line.

\begin{examplebox}
    Find the equation of the line passing through $P(2,-1,3)$ and having direction vector
    \[
        \mathbf{v}=[4,2,-1].
    \]

    \textbf{Vector form:}
    \[
        \mathbf{r} = [2,-1,3] + t[4,2,-1].
    \]

    \textbf{Parametric form:}
    \[
        x = 2+4t,\qquad y = -1+2t,\qquad z = 3-t.
    \]

    \textbf{Symmetric form:}
    \[
        \frac{x-2}{4} = \frac{y+1}{2} = \frac{z-3}{-1}.
    \]
\end{examplebox}

\begin{noteBox}
    In engineering, parametric line equations are useful in robotics path planning, motion control,
    computer graphics, and modeling the trajectory of moving objects.
